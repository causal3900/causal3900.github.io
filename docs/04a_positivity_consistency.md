# Positivity and consistency

**Sep 12**

> Reading: After class, read [Hern√°n and Robins 2020](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) Chapter 3.3--3.5.

This class will introduce two key assumptions: positivity and consistency.

1. **Positivity.** Every population subgroup receives every treatment value with non-zero probability
2. **Consistency.** Potential outcomes $Y^A$ are well-defined and linked to observable data

After class, you will be ready for a discussion in lab related to the consistency assumption.
