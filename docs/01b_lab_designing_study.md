# Lab: Designing a study

**Aug 23**

In this lab, we will start by getting to know one another. Then, you will discuss a hypothetical scenario.

A researcher (with whom you may disagree) says to you:
  > Coming to office hours frequently causes student success in the classroom.

In groups of about 3 students, discuss the following.

1. Imagine it is the **start** of the semester. How would you design a randomized experiment to assess this claim?
     * Imagine that you can assign students to a treatment condition and they will comply
     * Consider the details: who would you enroll, how would you define frequently, how would you assess success, etc.
2. Imagine it is the **end** of the semester. No randomized study was run. You want to conduct an observational study using administrative records (and you get IRB approval to do this). How would you design an observational study to assess this claim?

There is no expectation to have clear answers now. Over the course of the semester we will learn to formalize these types of questions and their solutions.
