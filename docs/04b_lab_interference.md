# Lab: Interference

**Sep 13**

When defining causal effects, we often discuss the outcome $Y^a$ that a person would realize if they were exposed to treatment value $a$. But definitions become harder if there exists **interference**: the outcome of unit $i$ depends on the treatment assigned to unit $j$. If improperly addressed, interference can violate the consistency assumtion.

In this lab, the TA will present an example study where interference is likely to be present and we will discuss how to expand our potential outcome notation to accomodate interference.
