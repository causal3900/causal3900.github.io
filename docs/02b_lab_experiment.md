# Lab: Interference

When defining causal effects, we often discuss the outcome $Y^a$ that a person would realize if they were exposed to treatment value $a$. But definitions become harder if there exists **interference**: the outcome of unit $i$ depends on the treatment assigned to unit $j$. In this lab, the TA will present an example study where interference is likely to be present and we will discuss how to expand our potential outcome notation to accomodate interference.
