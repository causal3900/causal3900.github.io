# Directed Acyclic Graphs

**Warning.** As we develop this website, the material below is a draft at teaching these concepts and until we finalize the page it is possible that a definition has a technical error.

## Marginal independence

> Sep 14. After class, read [Hern치n and Robins 2020](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) Chapter 6.1 and 6.2. For historical reference, optionally see [Greenland, Pearl, and Robins 1999](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Abstract/1999/01000/Causal_Diagrams_for_Epidemiologic_Research.8.aspx).

This class will introduce key ideas about DAGs.

1. **Path.** A path is a sequence of edges connecting two nodes
2. **Causal path.** A path is causal if all arrows point forward: $A\rightarrow B\rightarrow C$
3. **Backdoor path.** A backdoor path contains edges that do not point the same direction: $A\leftarrow B \rightarrow C$
4. **Collider along a path.** A node such as $B$ where to directed edges collide: $A\rightarrow B \leftarrow C$

DAGs help us know if variables $A$ and $B$ are statistically related

* $A$ and $B$ are *marginally dependent* if and only if there exists a path connecting them that does not contain a collider
* $A$ and $B$ are *marginally independent* if and only if any paths connecting them contain a collider

  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node (l) at (0,0) {$L$};
    \node (a) at (1,0) {$A$};
    \node (y) at (2,0) {$Y$};
    \draw[->] (l) -- (a);
    \draw[->] (a) -- (y);
    \draw[->] (l) to[bend right] (y);
  \end{tikzpicture}

## Conditional independence

> Sep 19. After class, read [Hern치n and Robins 2020](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) Chapter 6.3 and 6.4, and especially Fine Point 6.1 of which this page is an abbreviation.

Often, we want to condition on some set of variables $\vec{L}$ so that conditional exchangeability holds. In a DAG, we want to block all backdoor paths between $A$ and $Y$.

This class introduces four rules related to blocking a path

1. A path is blocked if it contains an unadjusted collider
2. A path is blocked if it contains an adjusted non-collider
3. If a collider is adjusted, the collider no longer blocks the path
4. If a descendant of a collider is adjusted, the collider no longer blocks the path

**D-separation** is a concept that encompasses the above rules. Any pair or set of variables are d-separated (and thus independent) if the paths between them are blocked.

## Lab: Causal discovery

> Sep 20. After class, read [Hern치n and Robins 2020](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) Fine Point 6.3.

This lab will practice applying causal discovery algorithms. More coming soon.

## Sufficient adjustment sets

> Sep 21. After class, read [Hern치n and Robins 2020](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) 7.1--7.4.
