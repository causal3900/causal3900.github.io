# Exchangeability

**Sep 7**

> Reading: After class, read [Hern√°n and Robins 2020](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) Chapter 3.1 and 3.2.

This class will introduce three key ideas:

1. **Exchangeability.** The assumption that treated and untreated units are **exchangeable** in the sense that the observed potential outcome for one set is informative about the unobserved potential outcome for the other set.
2. **Conditional exchangeability.** The assumption that exchangeability holds within subpopulations where a vector of pre-treatment variables $\vec{L}$ takes a constant value $\vec\ell$
