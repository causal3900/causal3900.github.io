This will be a spooky class---it may cause you to fear that everything has fallen apart. To this point we have proceeded as though we had the entire population. We will now accept that our sample may be a small fraction of the population. This entails:

* the curse of dimensionality: there are many confounder strata
* many of those strata suffer empirical positivity problems

This class will set the stage for emerging from the curse of dimensionality via model-based causal inference, to begin now.
