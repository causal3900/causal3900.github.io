# Standardization

**Sep 5**

> Reading: After class, read [Hern√°n and Robins 2020](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) Chapter 2.3.

Standardization is an important statistical procedure with two steps:

* estimate the causal effect in each population subgroup
* average over the population distribution of subgroups

In conditionally randomized experiments, standardization is essential to yield unbiased estimates of the population average causal effect. This strategy will also be essential in observational studies that we will discuss soon.

By the end of class, you will be able to

* understand the idea of standardization
* recognize equality between standardization and inverse probability of treatment weighting
