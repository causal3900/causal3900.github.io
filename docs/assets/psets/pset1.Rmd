Using the mathematical notation we discussed in class, define the two potential outcomes to which Jose is referring

**Answer.** Your answer here

### 1.3 (7 points)

In a sentence or two, say how the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference applies to Jose's claim.

**Answer.** Your answer here

### 1.4 (7 points)

Using conditional expectations or probabilities, write the following in math: the probability of majoring in statistics is higher among students who attend Cornell than among students who attend NYU.

**Answer.** Your answer here

### 1.5 (7 points)

Give one reason why the average causal effect of attending Cornell versus NYU (from 1.2) might be different from the average descriptive difference (from 1.4) in rates of majoring in statistics.
