## 1. True or False {-}

For 1.1--1.5, use the graphs on problem set from the course website and answer True or False:  The $Z$ nodes (i.e., either $Z$ itself or the set $\{Z_1, Z_2, \ldots \}$) form a sufficient adjustment set to identify the causal effect of $A$ on $Y$. Explain your answer in one sentence. If False, state the backdoor path that is unblocked conditional on $Z$.

## 2. Causal models of discrimination {-}
We will examine the causal claims of the paper ["Sex Bias in Graduate Admissions: Data from Berkeley" by Bickel, Hammel, and O'Connell (Science, 1975)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.187.4175.398) and a subsequent criticism from ["What Is Your Estimand? Defining the Target Quantity Connects Statistical Evidence to Theory" by Lundberg, Johnson, and Stewart (American Sociological Review, 2021)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00031224211004187). This particular example and discussion will highlight how clearly articulating a causal diagram may strengthen or weaken a causal claim.

In their paper, Bickel, Hammel, and O'Connell analyze claims of discrimination in graduate school admissions at Berkeley. In particular, they examine data from the 1973 admissions cycle. That year, there were 8,442 men applicants (of which 44\% were admitted) and 4,321 women applicants (of which 35\% were admitted). They state that while this disparity is concerning, they do not believe that it is due to gender discrimination. In particular, they note that programs which have lower overall admissions rates tend to have a higher proportion of women applicants and programs which have higher overall admissions rates tend to have a lower proportion of women applicants (see Figure 1 of their paper). Although they do not use a causal diagram in their article, given their argument, their causal model could be interpreted as follows: 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/psets/bickel.png") 
```


Thus, they claim that the total effect of gender on admission rates includes the effect due directly to gender (via the edge $\text{Gender} \rightarrow \text{Admission}$) as well as an effect due to applying to different departments (via the path $\text{Gender} \rightarrow \text{Department} \rightarrow \text{Admission}$). If there is a causal effect via the edge $\text{Gender} \rightarrow \text{Admission}$, that would indicate gender discrimination. However, a causal effect through the path $\text{Gender} \rightarrow \text{Department} \rightarrow \text{Admission}$ does not indicate discrimination directly due to gender.

Technically conditioning on Department does not satisfy the backdoor criterion since Department is a descendant of Gender. However, **if** their DAG is correct, conditioning on Department blocks the association between Gender and Admission which is due to applying to differing Departments. Thus, the only remaining association would be due to a direct effect of Gender on Admission (i.e., gender discrimination). In their data analysis, after conditioning on Department, the direct effect of gender on admission rate is negligible and they conclude that gender discrimination is not present. 

However, Lundberg, Johnson, and Stewart posit an alternative causal model which shown below. They include a new variable in the data: whether or not an individual applies to Berkeley. Because the only data that can be gathered concerns individuals who did in fact apply to Berkeley, this variable *is implicitly conditioned on*.  They note that gender may influence whether or not an applicant applies to Berkeley (perhaps if there is a reputation of discrimination, then women would be less likely to apply) and obviously whether or not an applicant applies affects whether or not they are admitted. Furthermore, they argue that there are plausible common causes of "Apply to Berkeley" and "Admit." For instance, individuals with higher GRE scores are more likely to apply to Berkeley and are also more likely to be admitted. They also include a mediator between "Gender" and "admission", the variable "Perceived Gender," which indicates how an individual is perceived by the admissions committee. The causal diagram of Lundberg, Johnson and Stewart is included below.

### 2.1 (8 pts) {-}
In the causal diagram posited by Lundberg, Johnson, and Stewart, list all the paths from Gender to Admit and state whether they are causal or spurious. For each of the paths, indicate whether each node on that path is a collider or non-collider. There should be 4 paths total.

**Answer.** 

* Path 1:
* Path 2:
* Path 3:
* Path 4:

### 2.2 (8 pts) {-}
In the analysis by Bickel, Hammel, and O'Connell, they explicitly condition on Department and implicitly condition on Apply to Berkeley (since those are the only applicants they have data on). For each path above, determine if the path is open or blocked when conditioning on those two variables ("Apply to Berkeley" and "Dept"). Explain why.

**Answer.** 

* Path 1: 
* Path 2:
* Path 3:
* Path 4:


### 2.3 (5 pts) {-}
One may argue whether or not the causal diagram posited by Lundberg, et. al. is correct. However, if the causal diagram posited by Lundberg, Johnson, and Stewart is true, does the analysis by Bickel, Hammel and O'connell correspond to a causal effect? Explain why or why not?
