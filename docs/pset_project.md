# Course Project {-}

The course project is an opportunity to engage with the course content via a real-world example. Over the course of the semester, you will walk through an entire causal analysis: starting with defining a causal question all the way to communicating the results of your analysis. Parts of this project will be done as individuals and parts will be completed as a group. We will assign parts of the project throughout the semester and we will give detailed instructions each time. We will also have plenty of check-ins along the way to make sure you're on the right track.
