To this point, we have not used any statistical models. Instead, we have

- taken means within subgroups
- then aggregated over subgroups

Today we will discuss how this strategy breaks down when there are many confounding variables, and thus many subgroups.

## Worked example of statistical modeling

This section presents math and code for a worked example of statistical
modeling, including

- outcome modeling
- inverse probability of treatment weighting
- matching

We use these methods to answer a causal question:

> To what degree does completing a 4-year college degree by age 25
> increase the probability of having a college-educated spouse or
> residential partner at age 35?

The theory that motivates this question is as follows. College causes
people to personally have higher earnings. But it also affects the
probability that someone lives with a high-earning partner. A college
degree thus affects household incomes not only through its effect on
individual earnings but also through its effect on how individuals pool
into households.

### Data access

We have prepared data for you to study this question. You will need to
download these data directly from the data distributor for the [National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997](https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy97.htm)
cohort. Here is how to do that.

First, download two supporting files from us:

- [nlsy97.NLSY97](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YcyaC1R5u9_d0-AX4ivqDiU0bRnEsAsJ/view?usp=sharing)
  is a tagset file containing the variable names
- [prepare_nlsy97.R](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fUdlhEsGGC0shREvu4znPPmJjtNi--Ko/view?usp=sharing)
  is an R script to prepare the data

put those files in a directory where you will work

Next, download data from the NLSY97.

- register with the survey
- log in to the NLS Investigator
- choose the NLSY97 study
- upload the tagset you downloaded from us
- download the data. When you do so, change the file name from `default`
  to `nlsy97`
- unzip the file. Find nlsy97.dat in the unzipped folder
- drag that file into the folder where you will work

In your R console, run the line of code below

``` r
install.packages("tidyverse") # if you do not have it yet
install.packages("Amelia")    # if you do not have it yet
source("prepare_nlsy97.R")
```

After following these steps, the data are in your working directory! You
can load the data quickly in the future by typing

``` r
library(tidyverse)
d <- readRDS("d.RDS")
```

Why can’t we just send you the data? Two reasons!

1.  The NLSY97 created a procedure to register users to encourage
    ethical use of the data for research
2.  By registering, you help the Bureau of Labor Statistics to know how
    many people are using the data, which is helpful for demonstrating
    the wide use of the data and is useful when securing funding for
    future surveys!

### Worked example: Outcome modeling

Outcome modeling is based on the following identification result, which
translates a causal quantity to a statistical estimand that does not
involve counterfactual outcomes.

$$\begin{aligned}
&E(Y^a) \\
&\text{by law of iterated expectation,}\\
&= E(E(Y^a\mid \vec{L})) \\
&\text{by exchangeability,}\\
&= E(E(Y^a\mid \vec{L}, A = a)) \\
&\text{by consistency,}\\
&= E(E(Y\mid \vec{L}, A = a))
\end{aligned}$$

We use the sample mean as our estimator for the outer expectation, and
we will discuss several estimators for the inner conditional
expectation. $$\begin{aligned}
\hat{E}(Y^a) &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \hat{E}(Y\mid \vec{L} = \vec\ell_i, A = a)
\end{aligned}$$

Now for intuition: that estimator tells to

1.  for each unit $i$ in our sample, estimate the expected outcome among
    people who look like this unit ($\vec{L} = \vec\ell_i$) but who got
    the treatment value of interest $A = a$.
2.  take the average of that estimate over all units

A **nonparametric** strategy in step (1) is to literally estimate the
expected outcome by taking the sample average among units who are
identical to unit $i$ along the confounders $\vec{L}$. But if there are
many confounding variables and few units, that might be few or zero
cases! A **parametric** strategy is to assume a model for the outcome,
such as

$$E(Y\mid \vec{L} = \vec\ell, A = a) = \alpha + a\beta + \vec\ell'\vec\gamma$$
where the parameters $\{\alpha,\beta,\vec\gamma\}$ could be estimated by
Ordinary Least Squares regression.

``` r
outcome_model <- lm(y ~ a + sex + race + 
                      mom_educ + dad_educ + 
                      log_parent_income +
                      log_parent_wealth +
                      test_percentile,
                    data = d)
```

Note: This could be any model you like! For example, you could add
interactions or use logistic regression instead.

With our model, we then want to predict the expected outcome under
treatment value $a$ for every unit with that unit’s observed confounder
values.

$$\hat{E}(Y\mid \vec{L} = \vec\ell_i, A = a) = \hat\alpha + a\hat\beta + \vec\ell'_i\hat{\vec\gamma}$$
In code, we would

1.  modify every unit’s treatment to the value $a$
    - intuition: if we actually intervened on this treatment in the
      world, the value of the treatment would change but the values of
      $\vec{L}$ would remain unchanged

``` r
# Make data where all are treated
d_if_treated <- d %>%
  mutate(a = "college")
# Make data where all are untreated
d_if_untreated <- d %>%
  mutate(a = "no_college")
```

2.  predict the outcome for every unit

``` r
predicted_outcome <- d %>%
  mutate(yhat1 = predict(outcome_model,
                         newdata = d_if_treated),
         yhat0 = predict(outcome_model,
                         newdata = d_if_untreated))
```

3.  average over the sample

``` r
predicted_outcome %>%
  summarize(average_yhat1 = mean(yhat1),
            average_yhat0 = mean(yhat0),
            average_effect = mean(yhat1 - yhat0))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   average_yhat1 average_yhat0 average_effect
    ##           <dbl>         <dbl>          <dbl>
    ## 1         0.427         0.164          0.263

In the code above, we estimated three causal quantities

1.  $E(Y^1)$, the probability that a respondent would have a
    college-educated spouse or partner if we intervened to assign them
    to a college degree themselves
2.  $E(Y^0)$, the probability that a respondent would have a
    college-educated spouse or partner if we intervened to assign them
    to no college degree themselves
3.  $E(Y^1-Y^0)$, the average causal effect of a college degree on
    having a spouse or partner with a college degree

### Worked example: Treatment modeling

Using a different identification result, we can also proceed by a
parametric model for the treatment instead of the outcome. By this
strategy, the population mean outcome $E(Y^a)$ under treatment $a$
equals the weighted average over all units at their observed treatment,
weighted by a weight that equals

- when $A = a$, the inverse probability of treatment
- when $A\neq a$, zero

Below is an identification proof for inverse probability of treatment
weighting.

The math above is complicated, but the intuition is simpler: by
weighting, we create a pseudo-population in which treatment $A$ is
independent of the confounders $\vec{L}$. To do that, we need to know
the propensity score: the probability of the observed treatment value
given the confounders.

The identification result points toward an inverse probability of
treatment weighting estimator known as the Horvitz-Thompson estimator,
$$\hat{E}(Y^a) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{Y_i\mathbb{I}(A_i=a)}{\hat{P}(A = a\mid\vec{L} = \vec\ell_i)}$$
A related estimator that is often used is the Hajek estimator, which
normalizes the weights to sum to 1.
$$\hat{E}(Y^a) = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{\mathbb{I}(A_i=a)}{\hat{P}(A = a \mid \vec{L} = \vec\ell_i)}}\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{Y_i\mathbb{I}(A_i=a)}{\hat{P}(A = a\mid\vec{L} = \vec\ell_i)}$$

In code, we would

1.  estimate a model for the probability of treatment given confounders,
    for example by logistic regression

``` r
treatment_model <- glm(I(a == "college") ~ 
                         sex + race + 
                         mom_educ + dad_educ + 
                         log_parent_income +
                         log_parent_wealth +
                         test_percentile,
                       data = d,
                       family = binomial)
```

2.  for every unit, predict the probability that $A = \text{College}$

``` r
predicted_p_college <- d %>%
  mutate(p_college = predict(treatment_model,
                             # the line below tells R
                             # to predict a probability
                             # rather than log odds
                             type = "response"))
```

3.  estimate the probability of the treatment observed

- for those who went to college, this equals `p_college`
- for those who did not, this equals `1 - p_college`

This quantity is often called the *propensity score*. It encapsulates
all information contained in confounders about the probability of
treatment.

``` r
predicted_p_scores <- predicted_p_college %>%
  mutate(propensity_score = case_when(
    a == "college" ~ p_college,
    a == "no_college" ~ 1 - p_college
  ))
```

4.  estimate mean outcomes among those with each treatment, weighted by
    the inverse propensity score. There are actually two ways to do
    this.

- the Horvitz-Thompson estimator relies on the fact that the true
  propensity scores sum to the number of observations

``` r
predicted_p_scores %>%
  summarize(y1 = mean(y * I(a == "college") / propensity_score),
            y0 = mean(y * I(a == "no_college") / propensity_score))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 2
    ##      y1    y0
    ##   <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 0.374 0.164

- the Hajek estimator uses the weighted mean, thus normalizing weights
  to sum to 1

``` r
predicted_p_scores %>%
  group_by(a) %>%
  summarize(estimate = weighted.mean(y, w = 1 / propensity_score))
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 2
    ##   a          estimate
    ##   <chr>         <dbl>
    ## 1 college       0.401
    ## 2 no_college    0.163

While both are asymptotically valid, there are finite-sample reasons to
prefer the second estimator (Hajek).

### Worked example: Matching

We could also estimate by matching. Matching can be interpreted as an
outcome modeling strategy where the conditional mean outcome
$E(Y\mid\vec{A} = a, \vec{L} = \vec\ell_i)$ is estimated by the mean
outcome among a set of units whose confounder values are similar to
those of unit $i$ but who received the treatment value $a$ of interest.

One way of defining \`\`similar’’ is by propensity score matching: find
units whose probability of treatment given confounders was close to the
probability for unit $i$. For example, the code below,

- estimates the probability of college completion using logistic
  regression
- for each person who finished college, matches them to a non-college
  graduate whose probability of completing college was similar

``` r
library(MatchIt)
matched <- matchit(a == "college" ~ sex + race + mom_educ + 
                     dad_educ + log_parent_income + 
                     log_parent_wealth + test_percentile,
                   method = "nearest", 
                   distance = "glm",
                   estimand = "ATT",
                   data = d)
```

The variable `matched$weights` has one element for each person in the
dataset. It indicates how many times that person appears in the matched
sample. There are

- 1,533 college graduates with weight 1
- 1,533 matched non-graduates with weight 1
- 4,705 non-matched non-graudates with weight 0

``` r
table(d$a,matched$weights)
```

    ##             
    ##                 0    1
    ##   college       0 1533
    ##   no_college 4705 1533

Within the matched data, the non-graduates and graduates are similar
along confounding variables. We could then estimate

- the probability of having a college educated spouse among college
  graduates by its mean among these people
- the probability that would have persisted for them if they had not
  finished college, by its mean among their matched counterparts

``` r
d %>%
  mutate(weight = matched$weights) %>%
  group_by(a) %>%
  summarize(p_spouse_college = weighted.mean(y, w = weight))
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 2
    ##   a          p_spouse_college
    ##   <chr>                 <dbl>
    ## 1 college               0.528
    ## 2 no_college            0.232

An even better estimator might use linear regression to adjust for
differences within the matched pairs that exist because matches are not
identical.

``` r
matched_fit <- lm(y ~ a*(sex + race + mom_educ + 
                           dad_educ + log_parent_income + 
                           log_parent_wealth + test_percentile), 
                  data = d, 
                  weights = matched$weights)
```

Then, predict potential outcoems from that matched fit and report the
expected outcome among college graduates under their factual treatment
and under

``` r
# Create data frames for prediction
college_grads_factual <- d %>%
  filter(a == "college")
college_grads_counterfactual <- college_grads_factual %>%
  mutate(a = "no_college")

# Predict outcomes from the model
college_grads_factual %>%
  mutate(yhat_college = predict(matched_fit, 
                                newdata = college_grads_factual),
         yhat_no_college = predict(matched_fit,
                                   newdata = college_grads_counterfactual)) %>%
  # Report estimated average outcomes
  select(starts_with("yhat")) %>%
  summarize_all(.funs = mean) %>%
  # Estimate the causal effect
  mutate(effect = yhat_college - yhat_no_college)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   yhat_college yhat_no_college effect
    ##          <dbl>           <dbl>  <dbl>
    ## 1        0.528           0.259  0.269

These results suggest that completing college increases the probability
of having a college-educated spouse or partner by about 27 percentage
points.
