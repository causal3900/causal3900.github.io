# Defining counterfactuals

## Observing versus intervening

> Aug 26. [**Slides**](assets/slides/1-1_observing_intervening.pdf)
After class, install R and Rstudio on your computer (see slide 17 from today's lecture).

Statistical inference is about observing: if I observe a sample from a population, what can I infer about that population? 
Causal inference is about intervening: if I intervene to change some exposure, what average outcome would result?

Today we will discuss observing, intervening, and why the difference is so important.



## Lab: Statistics review

> Aug 27. [**Slides**](discussion-1.-prob-stats-review), download [**.Rmd file**](assets/discussions/discussion01.Rmd)

In this lab, we will start by reviewing some basic statistical (random variables, expectation, conditional expectation, etc) and programming concepts.  


## Defining causal effects

> Aug 28. [**Slides.**](assets/slides/1-2_defining_causal_effects.pdf)
After class, read Chapter 1 of [Hern√°n and Robins 2020](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) and begin Problem Set 1.

Today we will define average causal effects in the potential outcomes framework.

By the end of class, you will be able to

* define potential outcomes
* explain the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference^[Holland [1986](https://doi.org/10.2307/2289064)]
