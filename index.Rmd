# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Cornell [STSCI](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA23/class/STSCI/3900) / [INFO](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA23/class/INFO3900) / [ILRST 3900](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA23/class/STSCI/3900). Causal Inference. Fall 2023.

Together, we will learn to make causal claims by combining data with arguments.

> **Warning.** This site is being actively developed. It is currently in a very rough state while we plan the course.

## Learning objectives {.unnumbered}

As a result of participating in this course, students will be able to

* define counterfactuals as the outcomes of hypothetical interventions
* identify counterfactuals by causal assumptions presented in graphs
* estimate counterfactual outcomes by pairing those assumptions with statistical evidence

## Is this course for me? {.unnumbered}

The course is designed for upper-division undergraduate students. We will assume familiarity with an introductory statistics course at the level of STSCI 2110, PAM 2100, PSYCH 2500, SOC 3010, ECON 3110, or similar courses.

Not a Cornell student? You are welcome to follow along on this site.

## Organization of the site {.unnumbered}

Each course module in the left panel will span several lectures. Within each module, the right panel will help you navigate. We will build this site over the course of the semester, uploading lecture slides as we go.
