# Analyzing an Experiment in R
In this lab we are going to explore an experiment that digs into the mechanisms
underlying __why people vote__. A long-standing theory as to why many people
vote is that it is driven by social norms (e.g. the understanding that voting
is their civic duty). This theory, while being a dominant theoretical 
explanation, had very little empirical backing for a long time. This experiment
examines this very theory by asking the question:
__to what extent do social norms cause voter turnout__?
