# Defining causal effects

**Aug 24**

> Reading: After class, read Chapter 1 of [Hernán and Robins 2020](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/).

Today we will define average causal effects in the potential outcomes framework.

By the end of class, you will be able to

* define potential outcomes
* explain the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference^[Holland [1986](https://doi.org/10.2307/2289064)]
* recall statistical concepts: random variables, expectation, conditional expectation
