# Interference

## Interference intro

> Nov 18 [**Slides.**](assets/slides/interference_intro.pdf)

Today we will introduce the idea of network interference. After class you should be able to:

* Explain what interference is and why it causes problems for standard estimators
* Use exposure mappings to model structure in interference


## Lab

> Nov 19

Lab today will be a chance for you to get started on the course project and ask questions with the TAs.

## Discussion on interference

> Nov 20 [**Slides.**](assets/slides/interference_estmator.pdf)

Today we will discuss two approaches for estimating the global average treatment effect under interference given data from a randomized control trial. After class you should be able to

* Use inverse probability weighting (IPW) to estimate global average treatment effect 
* Explain the implications of the choice of randomized design on the variance of the estimator
* Use model based regression to estimate global average treatment effect
