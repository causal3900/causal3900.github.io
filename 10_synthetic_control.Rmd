# Synthetic control



## Introduction

> Nov 12 [**Slides.**](assets/slides/10-1_synth_control.pdf) 

Today we will introduce the idea of synthetic control. After class you should be able to:

* Explain the intuition behind synthetic control
* Understand how synthetic control relates to other causal inference methods


## Lab

> Nov 13 [**Slides**](assets/discussions/synthetic_control_discussion.pdf)

We review the main idea behind synthetic control as well as compare and contrast synthetic control with matching and difference-in-differences. We also dig deeper into how to select weights in synthetic control and review a worked out example to assess performance of the method.

## Discussion

> Nov 14 [**Slides.**](assets/slides/10-2_synth_control_example.pdf). Read Chapter 10 of the Causal Inference Mixtape [Cunningham 2021](https://mixtape.scunning.com/10-synthetic_controls)

After class you should be able to:

* Understand how to conduct a hypothesis test for estimates
from a synthtic control analysis
* Reason about how interference will affect estimates from a synthetic control analysis
