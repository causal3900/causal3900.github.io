> I enjoy thinking about problems where the goal is to discover interpretable structure which underlies the data generating process. This includes problems in the areas of causal discovery, graphical models, and mixed membership models. In many cases, the methods are tailored for the high-dimensional setting where the number of variables considered may be large when compared to the number of observed samples. My applied interests vary but are generally social science related.

> I'm currently working on problems in causal inference under network interference. I think causal inference is really cool because it has applications across so many different fields. I'm generally interested in applications to public health, social welfare, and social good. In my free time, I enjoy singing, dancing, cooking, watching movies, and traveling to various theme parks.

> I am currently working on problem related to Causality, particularly on Causal and Graph discovery for Functional data. I am interested in how to learn interpretable structures from data with hidden confounders. In my free time I enjoy playing basketball, running and hanging out with friends.
