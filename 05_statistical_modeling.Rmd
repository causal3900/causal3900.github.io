# Statistical modeling

## Why model?

> Sep 26. [**Slides.**](assets/slides/5-1_why_model.pdf) After class, read [Hern치n and Robins 2020](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) Chapter 11.

To this point, we have not used any statistical models. Instead, we have

- taken means within subgroups
- then aggregated over subgroups

Today we will discuss how this strategy breaks down when there are many confounding variables, and thus many subgroups.

## Lab: Parametric g-formula

> Sep 27. Download the corresponding R Markdown file [**here**](assets/discussions/discussion6.Rmd).

Before discussion, make sure to download the data we'll be using. See the Ed Discussion post for more detail. 

After class, read [Hern치n and Robins 2020](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) Chapter 13 and 15.1.

## Inverse probability of treatment weighting

> Sep 28. [**Slides.**](assets/slides/5_3_ipw.pdf) Reading: After class, read [Hern치n and Robins 2020](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) Chapter 12.1--12.5.

Today will introduce how to estimate causal effects by modeling the probability of treatment, also known as the propensity score.
